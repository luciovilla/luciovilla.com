# luciovilla.com

This is my personal site to showcase my latest work and soon some of my writing. I've gone through many versions, static site generators and various CMSs to develop my personal site and finally feel like I found the right mix of technologies: React/Next.js.

## Built Using

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com)

## Running Locally

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/luciovilla/luciovilla.com.git
$ cd luciovilla.com
$ yarn
$ yarn dev
```
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

Create a `.env.local` file similar to [`.env.example`](https://github.com/luciovilla/luciovilla.com/blob/main/.env.example).

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new) from the creators of Next.js.
Check out their [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
